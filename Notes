Notes for the development of Capreole3D_V3

Also see the CVS logs

Visit to Morelia (Sep 28 - Oct 10, 2007):

Main changes to C2Ray_F90:
- Added optically thin case to radiation module
- Added recalculation of mean electron density
  to doric_module
- Added ALOSS-type cooling (H + approx. metal +
  equilibrium) to cooling_hm.f90.
- Added ionic_openmp.f90 with OpenMP parallelization
  according to the 8 octants.

Cleaned up code, added many only's to the use
statements.

Main changes to Capreole3D_V3
- Added new cart problems: 
   enrique2: different input files
   enrique_wind: stellar wind added
   gadget: GADGET input files
   constant: constant density

- Added restart option:
   restart from ah3 files.
   Mesh, grid and hydro read from ah3 file.
   Routines for this added to mesh, grid and
   hydro modules.

- Added OpenMP parallelization
   integrate_strang.f90 and roesol.f90 contain OpenMP 
   statements. Parallelization at the highest loop
   level of the 3 dimensional sweeps.

- Bugs:
   evolve was sending stnew to output routine,
   should be stold.

- Experiments (untested):
   VLFVS method (integrate_vlfvs.F90)
   Relaxing TVD method (integrate_tvd.F90, tvdsolver.f90)
